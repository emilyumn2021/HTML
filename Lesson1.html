		For this first lesson, we will be looking at very basic HTML5 structure.  We will start with headings.
		<p><h1>This is a Level 1 Heading.  This should only be used once per webpage</h1></p>
		<p><h2>This is a Level 2 Heading</h2></p>
		<p><h3>This is a Level 3 Heading</h3></p>
		<p><h4>This is a Level 4 Heading</h4></p>
		<p><h5>This is a Level 5 Heading</h5></p>
		<p><h6>This is a Level 6 Heading</h6></p>
		
		<br>
		
		Now, go into the HTML code view.  Notice how there is a different piece of HTML code for each heading
